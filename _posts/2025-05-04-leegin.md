![Kayâ€™s Kloset vs. Brighton Comic](../images/kay's closet.png)


Okay, let's dive right in. Imagine this. You're browsing in a a nice little boutique, Kay's Closet down in Texas. This is back in 2002,
right?
And they've got these stylish Brighton handbags. You know the ones, leather goods from Legion Creative Leather Products.
Yeah, I know the brand. Upscale stuff.
Exactly. Now K's closet, they decide, hey, let's offer a little discount.
Seems pretty standard, you know, good for the customer.
Seems harmless enough on the surface. Yeah. A little markdown,
but uh Oh, Legion was not happy about that. They had this really strict no discount policy.
Ah, right. They were going for that exclusive brand image.
Totally. They wanted Brighton seen as high-end quality and they also said it was about supporting retailers who, you know, offered good service and nice shopping experience, not just the lowest price.
Okay? So, they valued the service component,
right? So, when K's started discounting, Legion's response was, "Well, pretty drastic. They just cut off their supply. Boom. No more Brighton for K's closet. Wow. Okay. So, that little discount suddenly became a really big deal.
It really did. It kicked off this major legal battle. And that's what we're digging into today. This whole fight between Legion and Kay's closet. It revolves around something called resale price maintenance or RPM
and how antitrust law views it. It's fascinating because it shows how these big legal principles can shift based on well handbags in this case.
Exactly. And if you're listening, you're probably keen to understand these kinds of shifts, right? How economic and legal thinking evolves. So RPM, what is it? Basically,
it's pretty straightforward conceptually. It's when a manufacturer like Legion tells a retailer like Case Closet, "Look, you can sell our stuff, but you cannot sell it below this specific price, a minimum price."
Gotcha. A price floor set by the maker. Now, for the longest time, the legal stance on this was super clear, wasn't it?
Oh, absolutely. Crystal clear. There was this landmark case from way back in 1911, Dr. Miles Medical Co. versus Parkinson's.
Right. Dr. Miles. And what did that say? said RPM was per se illegal. Automatically illegal. End of story.
Per se.
Mhm.
Meaning you don't even need to ask why they did it or what the effect was. If you did it, you broke the law.
Exactly. No ifs, ands, or buts. It was just seen as inherently bad for competition under antitrust law. Which, by the way, is why K's Closet initially won their lawsuit against Legion. They pointed to Dr. Miles.
Makes sense. Case closed, right? based on precedent.
Well, you'd think so, but Legion didn't give up. They appealed and appealed all the way to the Supreme Court
against a nearly century old rule. What made them think they had a shot? That seems like a long shot.
Yeah, it does. But things had started to change behind the scenes, specifically in the world of economics.
Ah, the economist weigh in,
right? By the early 2000s, you had a growing number of economists looking at RPM and saying, "Hold on a second. Is this always bad?" They started arguing that actually sometimes RPM might not hurt competition. and it might even help it.
Okay, that's a big shift in thinking from always illegal. What kind of arguments were they making? How could setting minimum prices help competition?
One of the main arguments was about preventing something called freewriting.
Freewriting like getting something for nothing.
Sort of. Imagine you have two stores selling say those Brighton bags. Store A invests loads in beautiful displays, knowledgeable staff who explain the quality, offer great service, Okay, the full experience,
right? Store B down the street does none of that. They just pile the bags high and slash the price, maybe relying on the reputation store A helped build. Without RPM, store B can undercut store A
because they don't have all those service costs.
Exactly. And they might steal sales from store A, potentially driving them out of business. The economists argued this could actually hurt consumers in the long run, leaving them with less service, less information.
H, I can see that the discounter benefits from the service. providers efforts without paying for them.
Precisely. And there were other points too like protecting brand image especially for luxury or high-end goods. Constant discounting can dilute that exclusive feel. Right.
Yeah. Makes it seem less special if it's always on sale.
And they also argued RPM could encourage retailers to invest more in that instore experience we talked about. If they know they can maintain a certain margin, they might be more willing to spend on creating a nicer atmosphere, better service, things beyond just price.
So better shop experiences potentially. These arguments must have been pretty persuasive.
They were persuasive enough for the Supreme Court. In 2007, in the Legion versus PSKS case, PSKS was the owner of K's Closet. The court issued a landmark 5 to4 decision.
Don't leave us hanging.
They overturned Dr. Miles. That century old pers rule gone.
Wow. So, just like that, RPM wasn't automatically illegal anymore.
Just like that. Well, not quite so simple. They didn't say RPM was now automatically legal either.
Okay. So, what And if it's not always illegal, how do we know if it is illegal?
They replaced the persail rule with something called the rule of reason.
The rule of reason sounds reasonable. What does it mean in practice?
It means courts now have to look at the specific facts of each case. They have to analyze the situation, the market, the company, the policy, and decide whether this particular RPM agreement actually harms competition or potentially helps it.
So, it's a balancing act, weighing the pros and cons.
Exactly. Think of it like scales on One side you put the potential anti-competitive effects, higher prices for consumers, less retailer choice. On the other side, the potential pro-co competitive justifications preventing freewriting, enhancing brand image, promoting service. The court has to figure out which way the scales tip in that specific instance.
Much more complex than the old rule. So, it really depends. Can you give an example? When might RPM still be seen as bad under this rule of reason?
Sure. Imagine a huge manufacturer like someone who dominates 80% of the market for a certain product. If impose RPM across all the retailers. That could look really suspect. It might just be a way to keep prices high everywhere, stifling any real price competition. That would likely fail the rule of reason test.
Okay, market dominance is a red flag. When might it be okay or even good?
Well, think about a smaller company, maybe a new brand, trying to break into a market crowded with big players. They might use RPM to ensure retailers have enough incentive, enough profit margin to really promote the product, explain its features, give it good shelf space.
Ah, so it could help level the playing field for smaller brands against giants
potentially. Yes. In a competitive market with lots of choices, that kind of RPM might be seen as reasonable, maybe even pro competitive because it helps bring a new option to consumers effectively.
Got it. So after 2007, after Legion, what was the fallout? Did manufacturers rush to implement minimum prices?
We definitely saw more flexibility for manufacturers. They could now consider RPM without facing automatic illegality. Yes, there was experimentation particularly in sectors like luxury goods, high-end electronics, complex products needing explanation, and even online retail.
But it wasn't a free-for-all because of this rule of reason thing.
Exactly. It made things more complex legally. Companies had to be ready to justify their policies, and courts had to do this detailed analysis. It wasn't just did you set a minimum price guilty anymore.
So, what are the key factors a court or say the FTC looks at now when evaluating RPM? Under the rule of reason,
several things are crucial. First, as we mentioned, does the manufacturer using RPM have significant market power? Are they a big fish or a small fry?
Makes sense. What else?
They look at the nature of competition in that market. Are retailers primarily competing on price or is service a big factor? If RPM genuinely promotes better service or prevents harmful free writing, that weighs in its favor.
Okay. Market power, type of competition, anything else.
The ultimate question really is, is there actual harm to consumers? Does this specific RPM policy lead to significantly higher prices overall? Does it reduce output or choices available to shoppers in a meaningful way? That's the bottom line.
So, let's loop back to K's closet in Brighton. Under this new rule of reason, how might that case have been analyzed differently?
Well, the court would have had to ask, how much market power did Brighton really have in the handbag market back then? Were there plenty of other competing handbag brands available at various price points?
Right? Were consumers still able to find alternatives? easily.
Exactly. And was Leon's policy genuinely about supporting service and brand image in a competitive field or was it effectively shutting down legitimate price competition from a retailer like K's? It becomes a much more detailed factual investigation.
It really underscores that this area of law isn't static. It's not black and white.
Absolutely not. Antitrust law evolves. It responds to new economic theories, changing market realities, different legal arguments. The Legion case is a prime example. of that evolution.
And for you listening thinking about maybe buying electronics or fancy kitchen gadgets online, this means a manufacturer setting a minimum advertised price isn't automatically illegal. There might be justifications considered legitimate. Now,
it adds nuance. It requires looking beyond just the price tag to the potential effects on service, brand value, and overall market competition.
It's kind of wild to think, though, that a dispute over, you know, handbags could cause such a fundamental shift in decades of legal precedent and economic policy.
It really is. It just shows how these specific cases, even when starting in a small boutique, can ripple outwards and reshape the entire legal landscape for businesses and consumers.
A powerful reminder that law and economics are constantly interacting and evolving, sometimes in unexpected ways driven by, well, fashion accessories.
Indeed, which kind of leads to a final thought for you to mull over.
Oh, go.
Given that rule like the per se illegality of RPM which stood for nearly a hundred years could be overturned because economic thinking shifted. What other bedrock principles maybe in law, maybe in economics that we take for granted today, might be up for re-evaluation in the future as our understanding and our world continue to change.
