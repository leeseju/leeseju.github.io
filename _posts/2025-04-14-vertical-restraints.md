# 🎙️ Vertical Restraints and the Design of Efficient Supply Contracts

Welcome to this written adaptation of a podcast episode from *Market Structures in Focus*.  
In this post, we explore **vertical restraints**—contractual mechanisms like **Resale Price Maintenance (RPM)** and **Two-Part Tariffs**—and how they are used strategically to address uncertainty in supply chains. We’ll also dive into a key theoretical framework by **Rey and Tirole (1986)**.

## 1. Introduction to Vertical Restraints

Vertical restraints refer to contract terms imposed by suppliers on downstream firms. These include:

- Exclusive dealing
- Territorial restrictions
- **Price controls** like RPM

Our focus today is on **RPM and two-part tariffs**, and how they relate to information asymmetry and uncertainty in markets.

---

## 2. Resale Price Maintenance (RPM)

**RPM** occurs when a supplier sets a **minimum** or **fixed resale price** for its downstream retailer.

### 📜 Legal Evolution

- **Dr. Miles v. Park & Sons (1911)**: RPM deemed *per se illegal*  
- **Leegin v. PSKS (2007)**: RPM to be judged under **rule of reason**

### 💡 Economic Rationale

RPM can:
- Prevent **free-riding** among retailers
- Encourage **service provision**
- Help maintain **brand positioning**

However, RPM imposes **price rigidity**, limiting retailers’ ability to respond to **demand shocks**.

---

## 3. Two-Part Tariffs as an Alternative

**Two-part tariffs** involve:

- A **fixed fee** for access to a product line  
- A **low marginal wholesale price** per unit

This structure grants **pricing flexibility** to the retailer and shifts some risk onto them, especially useful under **cost uncertainty**.

## 4. The Rey & Tirole (1986) Framework

> Rey and Tirole (1986), *The Logic of Vertical Restraints*, provide a foundational model on vertical contracts under asymmetric information.

### 🔍 Their key insight:

| Type of Uncertainty | Who Has Private Info | Optimal Contract |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Demand uncertainty  | Retailer             | **RPM**          |
| Cost uncertainty    | Retailer             | **Two-part tariff** |

- Under demand uncertainty, **RPM** ensures brand control while leveraging the retailer’s local knowledge.
- Under cost uncertainty, **two-part pricing** allows prices to reflect actual marginal costs.

## 5. Application: Fast Fashion Industry

**Fast fashion** (e.g., Zara, H&M) faces:

- **High demand volatility**
- **Short product life cycles**
- **Rapid turnover**

### In theory:
- RPM could be justified to protect brand image

### In practice:
- **Flexibility is crucial**  
- Firms rely on:
  - **Real-time inventory updates**
  - **Dynamic pricing**
  - **Hybrid contracts** (e.g., RPM + rebates or risk-sharing)

---

## 6. Conclusion

Vertical restraints are **context-dependent tools**. According to Rey & Tirole:

- Use **RPM** when **demand is uncertain** and **service incentives** matter
- Use **two-part tariffs** when **costs are unpredictable** and **pricing flexibility** is essential

In reality, firms often **combine mechanisms** to balance control and efficiency.
