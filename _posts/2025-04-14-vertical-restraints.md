# Vertical Restraints and Supply Contracts  
### RPM, Two-Part Tariffs, and Dealing with Uncertainty

In this post, I’d like to share key points from a podcast episode I recently prepared.  
It covers **vertical restraints** in supply chains—especially **resale price maintenance (RPM)** and **two-part tariffs**—and how these strategies help firms respond to **uncertainty** in demand and cost.  
We’ll also look at a well-known economic model from **Rey and Tirole (1986)** that helps explain when each type of contract might work best.

## 1. What Are Vertical Restraints?

Vertical restraints are agreements between firms at different levels of the supply chain—like manufacturers and retailers. These can include:

- Resale price restrictions (RPM)
- Exclusive territories
- Quantity or marketing conditions

Our focus here is on two pricing-related tools: **RPM** and **two-part pricing**.

## 2. Resale Price Maintenance (RPM)

**Resale price maintenance** means the manufacturer sets a **minimum price** (or sometimes a fixed price) that the retailer must charge customers.

### A bit of legal background:
- In the U.S., **RPM was considered automatically illegal** for nearly a century, starting with *Dr. Miles (1911)*.
- But in *Leegin v. PSKS (2007)*, the Supreme Court decided that **RPM should be judged case by case**, using what’s called the *rule of reason*.

### Why use RPM?
- It can help prevent **free-riding**—for example, when one store provides service but others undercut them on price.
- It can protect **brand image** and encourage **better service** from retailers.

But there’s a downside: **RPM makes prices rigid**. When demand drops, retailers can’t lower prices freely, even if that would help sell more.

## 3. Two-Part Tariffs

A **two-part tariff** is a different kind of contract. The retailer pays:

1. A **fixed fee** to get access to the product  
2. A **low wholesale price** per unit

This way, the manufacturer gets some guaranteed revenue from the fixed fee, and the retailer keeps the ability to set the final price.

This system is helpful when **costs are uncertain** at the retail level. Retailers can adjust prices based on local conditions like rent or wages.

## 4. Rey & Tirole (1986): When to Use Which?

Economists **Rey and Tirole (1986)** explained how different kinds of uncertainty call for different types of contracts.

| If this is uncertain... | And the retailer knows more about it... | Then the better contract is... |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Demand**              | Yes                                      | **RPM**                       |
| **Costs**               | Yes                                      | **Two-part tariff**           |

- When **demand is uncertain**, RPM lets the manufacturer set the price while the retailer decides how much to sell, based on what they know.
- When **costs are uncertain**, it's better to let the retailer adjust prices freely. That’s what two-part pricing allows.

## 5. What About Fast Fashion?

Let’s take **fast fashion** as an example—brands like Zara or H&M.

They face very **uncertain demand**, and trends change fast.  
At first glance, RPM could be helpful—it keeps the brand image consistent.

But in real life, **retailers need flexibility**. When a product doesn’t sell, they need to **lower prices quickly**. RPM can get in the way of that.

That’s why many firms in fast fashion use **more flexible contracts**, sometimes mixing tools like:

- RPM + rebates  
- Two-part pricing + inventory support  
- Dynamic pricing and real-time adjustments

---

## 6. Summary

Vertical restraints like RPM and two-part tariffs are **not always good or bad**.  
Their effects depend on the situation—how much uncertainty there is, and who has better information.

**Rey and Tirole’s model** gives a clear idea:
- If the retailer knows more about **demand**, RPM can help.
- If the retailer knows more about **costs**, two-part pricing is more flexible and efficient.

In real markets, firms often use **a combination of tools**, depending on the risks and goals they face.
