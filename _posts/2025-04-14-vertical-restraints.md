## Vertical Restraints and Supply Contracts  
### RPM, Two-Part Tariffs, and Dealing with Uncertainty

In this post, I’d like to share key points from a podcast episode I recently prepared.  
It covers **vertical restraints** in supply chains—especially **resale price maintenance (RPM)** and **two-part tariffs**—and how these strategies help firms respond to **uncertainty** in demand and cost.  
We’ll also look at a well-known economic model from **Rey and Tirole (1986)** that helps explain when each type of contract might work best.
